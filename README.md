# CheckUp
An appointment Scheduler in which you can schedule your appointment, track them and have a seperate admin dashboard which will be used by the admins to assess the appointment based on priority  and notify the person whose appointment is called.

# How this works
This porject has two dashboards: one for the admin who will be scheduling the appointments (by clicking on Call for Assessment) to asess them and the other for the individual mobile users who will book the slots and then both admin and the user will see the Live Queue first sorted on the base of how critical the condition is then on the basis of first come and first serve basis. 
There are three categories Critical, Delayed and Minor that would be determined by the questions the user will answer when he/she will book the appointment.

Once the appointment is booked the user cannot book another appointment until his/her appointment is called by the admin for assessment.
